Group Members: David Rochon and Joao Alves

We got all the way through step 5 after working with Dr. Black. You can now call exec number and exec letter and see both run. 
	You can also still type dir or other commands while they run. Joao was responsible for E and I, David, did D. So this is all Joao.
